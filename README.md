# Parents Patrol
## Jerusalem-union-against-drugs-and-alcohol

Parents patrols are neighborhood organizations of volunteers who go on patrols at times when youth go out to spend time outdoors. 
This is due to the understanding that today the streets in each neighborhood are a place of entertainment for large sections of the youth.
The aforementioned organization will use our applicatoin to manage parents patrol data documents, to fill patrol documents, and follow  teens whom the organization help. 

this project developed at Azrieli College of Engineering for a social project.
